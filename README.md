## Description
This Project is a CPU Process Scedhuling emulator for operating systems done in java, using the priority scedhuling algorithm with round robin. It takes the process ID, arrival time, burst time, and priority of process as input, then schedules the processes according to the algorithm, and then displays a Gantt chart showing the the order of processes and time taken by each process.

`App.java` is the main file

## Usage
1. Compile and run the program
```
javac *.java
App.java
```
2. Enter inputs based on the prompt [Quantum time, PID, Arrival time, Burst time and it's priority] or use one of the six preentered test cases.
3. If not a preentered test case, you may stop giving processes as input by giving a process a value of all zeros for all prompts.
